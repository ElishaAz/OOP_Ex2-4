# OOP_Ex2-4
This project is a base for displaying geographical info.
It contains the following packages:
<br/>  Geom: Geometrical shapes including lines, paths, circles, squares etc.
<br/>  Coords: Coordinates convertion from/to local, global coordinates.
<br/>  Gis: geographical info, devided into layers, with time, poition, color etc.
<br/>  Algorithms: Golbal Algorithms such as choosing inside of a square, choosing at a distance, transforming etc.
<br/>  File_format: Reading and Writing to and from CSV, JSON and KML files.

# Packman
This Project uses the base to create a kind of graphical "Game," where Packmen need to eat all the Fruit with minimal time.
Because this problem is simular to the Traveling Salesman Problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) with multiple salesmen (mTSP), an algorithm for solving mTSp was added to the package "Algorithms."
Note: the algorithm used is not optimal.

# Dependencies
<br/>  JAK (Java API for KML): https://labs.micromata.de/projects/jak.html
<br/>  JSON: http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/
  
Note: this Project was not yet fully completed, as it is an assignment for OOP at Ariel University.
